# ImgProcessingFilters

When running the script, you will get a prompt to load an image. You can use the test.jpg in the root folder.

Commands:

S - Save Image, save the image anywhere in the system
L - Load image, load an image from anywhere in the system
Q - Quit the app

I have a build of this app you can download from my OneDrive:
